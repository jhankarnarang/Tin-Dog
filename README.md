Learning repo to go with @angelabauer's awesome Web Design Udemy class, (https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/)

Note: If you're another of Angela's students looking to use this to compare to your own work, a word of warning - I've made several purposeful deviations from the class exercises, (generally for different view preferences and/or to try out other bits and pieces that I've learned while googling about) so if you're looking for a more rigorously faithful representation, you may be better served by looking for other folks' versions.
